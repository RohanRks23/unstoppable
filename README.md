## Getting Started: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Membership Plans

### For Gym Officials

[Managing Membership Plans](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5808d38d-f676-413d-89e6-4335a91edbc2)

Gym officials can easily access the **Membership Plan list** by clicking on **Membership Plans** shotcut in **Gym Dashboard Workspace** or by searching for it in the **Awesome Bar**. This will redirect them to the **Membership Plan Doctype List View**, where they can create multiple membership plans by defining their names, amenities, and pricing structures.

Additionally, they have the option to control the visibility of these plans‚Äîeither making them publicly available or restricting them to an exclusive inner circle.

**Note:** A new user can only access publicly available plans. Once they become a member, they gain access to exclusive inner-circle plans.

### For Members

**Accessing Membership Plans**

Users can visit the publicly accessible membership page via:
 - http://Domain/unstoppable or http://localhost:8000/unstoppable.

Video 2: Membership Registration Process

A dedicated webpage has been created where users can explore available membership plans. Clicking the ‚Äú**Register Now**‚Äù button redirects them to a web view of the **Membership Plans Doctype List View**.

**Users can:**

 - View plan details by clicking ‚Äú**View Plan.**‚Äù

 - Explore plan features through the detailed form view.

 - Book a membership by clicking the ‚Äú**Book Plan**‚Äù button.

Upon selecting a plan, the system will autofill the details. The user can then enter personal information, choose a preferred start and end date, and confirm the booking.

Once confirmed, a new record is created in the **Members Doctype**, storing the user‚Äôs details in the database. The user is then redirected to the **Members Doctype List View**.

### Membership Payment Process

Video 3: Payment Setup and Status Updates

Upon accessing their new membership record, users can review their provided details. Initially, the membership and payment status remain **‚ÄúPending‚Äù** until payment details are provided.

**To proceed with payment:**

The user clicks on the account number to create a new payment record.

A dialog box appears where they can enter their account number and save the details.

This generates a new payment record in the **Payment Doctype**, tracking all transactions.

The system automatically updates payment and membership statuses and calculates payment history details.

Video 4: Clearing Outstanding Dues

**To settle outstanding amounts:**

Users can click the **‚ÄúPay Now‚Äù** button, which redirects them to their **Payment Information** page.

The system autofills the outstanding amount along with the current date.

Clicking **‚ÄúPay Now‚Äù** confirms the payment, updating the payment history with the date and amount.

A comprehensive payment history is available in the **Payment Doctype**, listing all previous transactions.

Users can navigate back to the **Members Doctype** via the **‚ÄúBack to Members‚Äù** button, where the **Payments and Validity** section updates accordingly.

### Membership Renewal

Video 5: Renewing Membership Plans

If a user‚Äôs membership is nearing expiration or they wish to renew, they can do so by clicking the **‚ÄúRenew‚Äù** button. This action:

Transfers current membership details to the **Membership Renewals** section.

Clears previous plan details, allowing selection of a new plan.

**Note:** Once a user becomes a member, they gain access to both public and inner-circle membership plans. During renewal, users must manually select a new plan, specify start and end dates, and provide an account number for tracking transactions before saving the form.

### Attendance Management

Video 6: Tracking Member Attendance

Gym coaches can efficiently track attendance by clicking on **Gym Attendance** shotcut in **Gym Dashboard Workspace** or by searching for the **Attendance List** in the **Awesome Bar**. They can create new attendance records by:

Selecting a specific date.

Adding attending members to the **Members Attended Child Table**.

All supporting dashboards update automatically with new attendance data.

### Dashboard & Analytics
